            <p>
                 Hi I'm Chris and welcome to Whril! I started 
                 Whril because I've always enjoyed podcasts,
                 music, and topical dicussions, but felt the 
                 experience has always been lack luster. So if you enjoy 
                 listening to people and want to help creators create, 
                 then read on!
            </p>
            <h2>
                Our Product
            </h2>
            <p>
                At Whril we're building a home for 
                people who love to listen. Our 
                 goal is helping our creators 
                connect with listeners at perfect
                moments in time. Currently, we are looking 
                to hire an <b>iOS Software Engineer</b>,
                and our preference goes to someone who has
                experience with the Apple ecosystem,
                and loves to use the products they build. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Ideally, you will help us develop our iOS app, 
                assist in api development, and 
                develop from scratch new and exciting features for our 
                audio platform. Naturally, Whril is a social tool, but
                knowledge of internet communication or social media 
                 is not required. We do like to hire people who use 
                 the products they build, are content creators,
                 or actively participate in online communities. You will have room to 
                architect, develop, test and deliver independently, or within a small team. 
                We will work with you to further develop your skillsets and toolkit 
                if interested. We want everyone to chase life goals, and take pride 
                in supporting you. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We don't believe work occurs at a specific place or 
                within set hours. We believe creativity and hard work can happen 
                anywhere, anytime! We have studio offices that 
                are avaliable for teams or individuals to use freely &ndash; 
                our studio offices will open back up once we all feel safe.
            </p>
