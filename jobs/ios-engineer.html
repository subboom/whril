            <p>
                At Whril we want to help people
                chat easily, and find interesting 
                topics to listen to. 
                Currently, we are looking 
                to hire an <b>iOS Software Engineer</b>,
                our preference goes to someone who has
                 experience or extreme enthusiasm for building 
                high bandwidth platforms. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Ideally, you will own our iOS app, assist in api development, and 
                 build from scratch new and exciting features for our platform. 
                Knowledge of internet communication or social media 
                 is not required, but we enjoy working with people who naturally care
                 about the products they're building, and use the technology themselves. 
                You will have room to 
                architect, develop, test and deliver independently, or within a small team. 
            </p>

                our studio offices will open once the pandemic is over.
