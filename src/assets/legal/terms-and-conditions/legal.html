                        complete your Transaction and agree (a) to pay the applicable fees and any taxes; 
                        (b) that Whril may charge your credit card or third party payment processing account,

                        confirmed by Whril. All payments made are non-refundable and non-transferable except 
                        as expressly provided in these Terms.

                        payment processing charges unless you have made a reasonable attempt at resolving 
                        the matter directly with Whril.

                        fraudulent, or in other circumstances Whril deems appropriate in its sole discretion. 
                        Whril also reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to take steps to verify your 
                        identity in connection with your order. You may need to provide additional information

                        included within the definition of Payment Information). Whril will either not charge

                        You and Whril agree that any dispute, claim or controversy

                        “Disputes”) will be settled by binding arbitration, except 
                        that each party retains the right: (i) to bring an individual 
                        action in small claims court and (ii) to seek injunctive or 
                        other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction 
                        to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, 
                        misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, 
                        trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual 
                        property rights (the action described in the foregoing 
                        clause (ii), an “IP Protection Action”). Without limiting 
                        the preceding sentence, you will also have the right to 
                        litigate any other Dispute if you provide Whril with written 
                        notice of your desire to do so by email at <a href="">support@whril.com</a>
                        within thirty (30) days following the date you first agree 
                        to these Terms (such notice, an “Arbitration Opt-out Notice”). 
                        If you don’t provide Whril with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice 
                        within the thirty (30) day period, you will be deemed to have 
                        knowingly and intentionally waived your right to litigate any 
                        Dispute except as expressly set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) 
                        above. The exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any 
                        IP Protection Action or, if you timely provide Whril with 
                        an Arbitration Opt-out Notice, will be the state and federal 
                        courts located in the Northern District of California and each 
                        of the parties hereto waives any objection to jurisdiction and

                        may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may 
                        not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative 
                        proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, 
                        then the entirety of this “Dispute Resolution” section will be 
                        deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, 
                        this “Dispute Resolution” section will survive any termination 
                        of these Terms.

                 <p>
                        The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration 
                        Association (“AAA”) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration
                        Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes 
                        (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by this 
                        “Dispute Resolution” section. (The AAA Rules are available at 
                        <a href="https://www.adr.org/arb_med">www.adr.org/arb_med</a> or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) 
                        The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and 
                        enforcement of this Section.

                        Arbitration Process
                  </h2>
                  <p>
                      A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide 
                      the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as 
                      specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a general Demand 
                      for Arbitration form and a separate form for Demand for 
                      Arbitration for California residents.) The arbitrator will 
                      be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice 
                      law and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster 
                      of arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an 
                      arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand 
                      for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator 
                      in accordance with the AAA Rules.
                  </p>

                        Arbitration Location and Procedure
                  </h2>
                  <p>
                        Unless you and Whril otherwise agree, the arbitration will
                        be conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim 
                        does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be 
                        conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you 
                        and Whril submit to the arbitrator, unless you request 
                        a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing 
                        is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right 
                        to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject 
                        to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion 
                        to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, 
                        consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.

                  <p>
                        The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame 
                        specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator’s decision will 
                        include the essential findings and conclusions upon which 
                        the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration 
                        award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
                        The arbitrator’s award of damages must be consistent with the 
                        terms of the “Limitation of Liability” section above as to the 
                        types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable.
                        The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in 
                        favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide 
                        relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. If you prevail 
                        in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees 
                        and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. Whril 
                        will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under 
                        applicable law to recover, attorneys’ fees and expenses if it 
                        prevails in arbitration.

                        Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and 
                        arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. 
                        However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, 
                        Whril will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that 
                        either the substance of your claim or the relief sought 
                        in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought 
                        for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set 
                        forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).
