                                    We also use your first name to make an educated guess about your gender 
                                    and use information about your activity to help determine the likelihood 
                                    of you continuing to use our Services in the future 
                                    (which we hope will be the case!).

                        Subject to certain limitations and exceptions, the CCPA provides California consumers the right to request to know more details about the categories and specific pieces of personal information, to delete their personal information, to opt out of any “sales” that may be occurring, and to not be discriminated against for exercising these rights.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                        We do not “sell” the personal information we collect (and will not sell it in the future without providing a right to opt out).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                        California consumers may make a rights request by emailing us at <a href="">support@whril.com</a>. We will verify your request by asking you to provide information that matches information we have on file about you. Consumers can also designate an authorized agent to exercise these rights on their behalf, but we will require proof that the person is authorized to act on your behalf and may also still ask you to verify your identity with us directly.
