                                    We also use your first name to make an educated guess about your gender 
                                    and use information about your activity to help determine the likelihood 
                                    of you continuing to use our Services in the future 
                                    (which we hope will be the case!).

                        This section provides additional disclosures required by the California Consumer Privacy Act (or “CCPA”).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                        In the last 12 months, we collected the following categories of personal information: identifiers (such as name, contact information and device identifiers), internet or other electronic network activity information (such as browsing behavior), approximate geolocation data, inferences (such as approximate location or product interests) and other personal information (such as payment method information, user credentials or health-related information). For more details about the personal information we collect, including the categories of sources, please see the “Collection of Information” section above. We collect this information for the business and commercial purposes described in the “Use of Information” section above. We share this information with the categories of third parties described in the “Sharing of Information” section above.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                        Subject to certain limitations and exceptions, the CCPA provides California consumers the right to request to know more details about the categories and specific pieces of personal information, to delete their personal information, to opt out of any “sales” that may be occurring, and to not be discriminated against for exercising these rights.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                        We do not “sell” the personal information we collect (and will not sell it in the future without providing a right to opt out).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                        California consumers may make a rights request by emailing us at <a href="">support@whril.com</a>. We will verify your request by asking you to provide information that matches information we have on file about you. Consumers can also designate an authorized agent to exercise these rights on their behalf, but we will require proof that the person is authorized to act on your behalf and may also still ask you to verify your identity with us directly.
